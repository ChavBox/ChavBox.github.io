    I had heard of a organization called
    Outward Bound and after talking with <br>
    my parents, I decided to take a Semester course
    and gain outdoor experience.

    I spent 18 days in the wilderness of the  Gore Range,
    with a rendevous halfway <br>

  This was our setup in Joshua Tree, sleeping in
  the flood path of a <br>rock climber's backyard. After climbing our hearts

    I finished this journey by attempting

    experience I needed <br> before returning to school.
