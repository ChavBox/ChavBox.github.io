Exercise: Working with JSON Data

Working with data from the People in Space API create a site that presents
this information. The people in space API provides a JSON list of individuals
currently in space, including their names, the spacecraft they are
on, the total number of people in space. Use this information to
create that creatively visualizes this information. I encourage
you to think about interesting ways you would like to represent
this information.
